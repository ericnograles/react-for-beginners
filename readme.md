# Overview

![React Templates](https://i.imgflip.com/10413l.jpg "Too Damn High")

The intent of this starter project is to educate newcomers to React on the basics. Many templates out there can get a bit confusing, so this project strips down React to the bare bones while still having some development niceties.
